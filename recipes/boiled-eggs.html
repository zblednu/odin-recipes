            It's pretty trivial, boring, and plain dish. However, it is simple, it is fast, nutritious, and, most importantly, healthy.
        </p>
        <h3>Note:</h3>
        <p>
            I eat about 4 eggs a day, a pair in the morning, and a pair in the evening. 
            <br>
            Its up to you to decide on number of eggs, but don't eat too much - they contain alot of cholesterol(or so i've been told).

        <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt/pepper to your liking</li>
            <li>Spring onion to your liking</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill up the pot to the level when eggs are fully submerged, but don't put in the eggs yet.</li>
            <li>Boil the water.</li>
            <li>Gently put eggs in the water, use a tablespoon for this.</li>
            <li>Wait around 6 to 10 minutes, the more you wait the firmer the yolks will be.</li>
            <li>Drain the hot water and replace it with cold one.</li>
            <li>Let the eggs cool a minute or two and then peel them. Do this in the used water so the shell could come off easier.</li>
            <li>Cut them, season them with spices and spring onion, or eat it raw, you can't go wrong. Enjoy!</li>
